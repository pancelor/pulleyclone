# You're Pulleying My Leg

A clone of http://www.draknek.org/games/puzzlescript/pulleys.php

# How to run

clone project; open main.html; play in browser
coming soon: play online at https://pancelor.github.io/pulleyclone/

# todo

* make playing online work (need assets I guess?)
* decide frd what tiles are... seems like theyre mainly some static sprites and a full-screen collision mask? like in celeste?
