# todo

* load/save into local storage? and then import/export to user disk.
  * this makes editing possible on github
* decide frd what tiles are... seems like they're mainly some static sprites and a full-screen collision mask? like in celeste?

* light!
* space to drag objects around
* less hacky actor placing - currently it's essentially just another tile layer :/
* write undo system
* make game run on a frame clock
  * do pull-style keyboard instead of event interrupts... bah

* write a proper user-facing readme
